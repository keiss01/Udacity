### Customers Segmentation  and Responsiveness to Campaign Prediction for Arvato/Bertelsmann

#### motivation:

This project is the final project in the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program.
A detailed description of the project can can be found in this post: [Medium]()

#### Description:

The project consists of 3 parts:

1. Customer Segmentation Report
In this part I use unsupervised learning methods to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population in order to create customer segments.


2. Supervised Learning Model
In this pare I build a machine learning model, using supervised learning techniques, to predict whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.


3. Participation in Kaggle Competition
The goal of the competition is to get the best responsiveness predictions for a dataset of potential customers.
The details of the competition and the scores of the participants can be found here: [Udacity+Arvato: Identify Customer Segments | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/udacity-arvato-identify-customers/).
