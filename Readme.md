### Installation
No further libraries required beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.<br> 
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Project Motivation
I was curious about gernder ratios and gender based statistics among the respondents of the [StackOverflow survey of 2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)<br>
I was trying to answer the following 3 questions:<br>
1. What are the gender ratios per country for the 20 leading represented countries ?
2. How do the income distribution differ between the genders ?
3. Can we observe differences in job satisfaction levels between the genders ?

### Files Description

2. survey_results_schema_2020.csv<br>

3. StackOverflow_gender_analysis.ipynb<br>
